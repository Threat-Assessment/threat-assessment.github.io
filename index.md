## Overview

Threat Assessment aims to develop a desktop application for the School of Life Sciences (SoLS) at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. Twenty SoLS graduate students evaluated threat assessments for endangered species in the IUCN Red List, translating the reasoning into argument maps. This application will read and interpret texts from Excel spreadsheets, assess the quality of the students' argument maps, and compare how similar or different the maps are across students.

## Project Updates

This section provides ongoing updates about the project.

### Week of 01/20/25 
<!---1/22/24-->

We met as a team to introduce ourselves and discuss the project. We shared our schedules, initialized the project, and designated the point of contact. 


### Week of 01/27/25 
<!--01/28/24-->

We met with our project sponsor, Mark Burgman. Dr. Burgman went over the details of the project and explained his expectations for the application. He also introduced the concept of argument maps, dsicussed the purpose of the project, and shared example argument map spreadhssets that we may use when testing the app. 

### Week of 02/10/25
<!--02/10/24-->

We met again to further discuss and develop the application. After the needs for our project, we decided Pyhton would be the best programming language for the project. We also planned another meeting with Dr. Burgman to address some remaining questions about the project. 

### Weeks of 02/17 and 02/24/25 

We continued developing the application and meeting occasionally, but most of the work was done separately as one of our team members was sick during this period.
